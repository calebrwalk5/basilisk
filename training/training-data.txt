The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy work of
heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of journalist--very joyous,
irreverent young men. `Our Special Correspondent in the Day after To-morrow reports,' the
Journalist was saying--or rather shouting--when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed
in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had
startled me.
`I say,' said the Editor hilariously, `these chaps here say you have been travelling into the
middle of next week! Tell us all about little Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?'
The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word. He smiled quietly, in his
old way. `Where's my mutton?' he said. `What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!'
`Story!' cried the Editor.
`Story be damned!' said the Time Traveller. `I want something to eat. I won't say a word until I
get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And the salt.'
`One word,' said I. `Have you been time travelling?'
`Yes,' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head.
`I'd give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,' said the Editor. The Time Traveller pushed his
glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had
been staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner was
uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it
was the same with the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of
Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite
of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller through his
eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with
regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his
plate away, and looked round us. `I suppose I must apologize,' he said. `I was simply starving.
I've had a most amazing time.' He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. `But come
into the smoking-room. It's too long a story to tell over greasy plates.' And ringing the bell in
passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.
`You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?' he said to me, leaning back in
his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.
`But the thing's a mere paradox,' said the Editor.
`I can't argue to-night. I don't mind telling you the story, but I can't argue. I will,' he went on, `tell
you the story of what has happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptions. I
want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it! It's true--every word of it, all the
same. I was in my laboratory at four o'clock, and since then . . . I've lived eight days . . . such
days as no human being ever lived before! I'm nearly worn out, but I shan't sleep till I've told this
thing over to you. Then I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?'

began his story as I have set it forth. He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary
man. Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much keenness the
inadequacy of pen and ink --and, above all, my own inadequacy--to express its quality. You
read, I will suppose, attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker's white, sincere face in
the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation of his voice. You cannot know how his
expression followed the turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in
the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist and the legs of the
Silent Man from the knees downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at
each other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller's face.

`I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time Machine, and showed you the
actual thing itself, incomplete in the workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one
of the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it's sound enough. I expected
to finish it on Friday, but on Friday, when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one
of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so that the thing
was not complete until this morning. It was at ten o'clock to-day that the first of all Time
Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of
oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his
skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever
in one hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost immediately the
second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round, I saw the
laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my
intellect had tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at
a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!
`I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands, and went off with a
thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently
without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the
place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to
its extreme position. The night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came
to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. To-morrow night
came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur
filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.
`I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. They are excessively
unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless
headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on
pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory
seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky,
leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been
destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was
already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled
dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively
painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through
her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went
on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness;

https://www.fulltextarchive.comthe sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous color like that of early
twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter
fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a brighter circle
flickering in the blue.
`The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side upon which this house now
stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like
puffs of vapour, now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw
huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole surface of the earth
seemed changed--melting and flowing under my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that
registered my speed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed
up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that consequently my pace was
over a year a minute; and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and
vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.
`The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They merged at last into a kind
of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was
unable to account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind of madness
growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought
of anything but these new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my
mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread--until at last they took complete
possession of me. What strange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our
rudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim
elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture
rising about me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built
of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the hill-side, and remain there, without any
wintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so
my mind came round to the business of stopping,
`The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which I, or the
machine, occupied. So long as I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered;
I was, so to speak, attenuated--was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening
substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into
whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the
obstacle that a profound chemical reaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion --would result, and
blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions--into the Unknown. This possibility
had occurred to me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had cheerfully
accepted it as an unavoidable risk-- one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the risk was
inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light. The fact is that insensibly, the absolute
strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the feeling
of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told myself that I could never stop, and
with a gust of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over the
lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was flung headlong through the air.
`There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been stunned for a moment.
A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.
Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone. I
looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by
rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a
11 / 49
Full Text Archive
https://www.fulltextarchive.comshower under the beating of the hail-stones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over
the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin. "Fine
hospitality," said I, "to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you."
`Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and looked round me. A colossal
figure, carved apparently in some white stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons
through the hazy downpour. But all else of the world was invisible.
`My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew thinner, I saw the white
figure more distinctly. It was very large, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of
white marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being carried
vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me,
was of bronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the
sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was
greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood looking at
it for a little space--half a minute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede
as the hail drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment and saw
that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was lightening with the promise of
the Sun.
`I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity of my voyage came
suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What
might not have happened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in
this interval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something inhuman,
unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal,
only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness--a foul creature to be
incontinently slain.
`Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns, with a
wooded hill-side dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a
panic fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I did so the
shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and
vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky,
some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings about me stood
out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out in white by the
unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a
bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear grew to
frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with
the machine. It gave under my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One
hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again.
`But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I looked more curiously and
less fearfully at this world of the remote future. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the
nearer house, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and their
faces were directed towards me.
`Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the White Sphinx were
the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to
the little lawn upon which I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature--perhaps four feet
12 / 49

https://www.fulltextarchive.comhigh--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt. Sandals or buskins--I could
not clearly distinguish which--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head
was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was.
`He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribably frail. His flushed
face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we
used to hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my hands from
the machine.
IV
`In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile thing out of futurity. He
came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of
fear struck me at once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to
them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.
`There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these
exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into my head, oddly
enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to
my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand. Then I
felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real.
There was nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little
people that inspired confidence--a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides,
they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine-
pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the
Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto
forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the little levers that would set
it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of
communication.
`And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiarities in their
Dresden-china type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at
the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were
singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran
to a point. The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism on my part--I fancied
even that there was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.
`As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round me smiling and
speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the conversation. I pointed to the Time
Machine and to myself. Then hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the sun.
At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture, and
then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder.
`For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was plain enough. The
question had come into my mind abruptly: were these creatures fools? You may hardly
understand how it took me. You see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight
Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art, everything.
Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him to be on the intellectual level
of one of our five-year-old children-- asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a
13 / 49

https://www.fulltextarchive.comthunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their clothes, their frail light limbs,
and fragile features. A flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I
had built the Time Machine in vain.
`I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled
them. They all withdrew a pace or so and bowed. Then came one laughing towards me,
carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea
was received with melodious applause; and presently they were all running to and fro for
flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You
who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers
countless years of culture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should be
exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble, which had
seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice
of fretted stone. As I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly
grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible merriment, to my mind.
`The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal dimensions. I was naturally most
occupied with the growing crowd of little people, and with the big open portals that yawned
before me shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over their heads
was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long neglected and yet weedless
garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across
the spread of the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegated shrubs,
but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted
on the turf among the rhododendrons.
`The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not observe the carving very
narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through,
and it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather- worn. Several more brightly clad
people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century
garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an eddying
mass of bright, soft-colored robes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of laughter and
laughing speech.
`The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown. The roof was in
shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted
a tempered light. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not
plates nor slabs--blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the going to and fro of past
generations, as to be deeply channelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the
length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised perhaps a foot from the
floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognized as a kind of hypertrophied
raspberry and orange, but for the most part they were strange.
`Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon these my conductors
seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they
began to eat the fruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round
openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their example, for I felt thirsty and
hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall at my leisure.
`And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look. The stained-glass windows,
14 / 49
Full Text Archive
https://www.fulltextarchive.comwhich displayed only a geometrical pattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that
hung across the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the
marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect was extremely rich and
picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of
them, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with interest, their little eyes
shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same soft and yet strong, silky
material.
`Fruit, by the by, was all their diet. These people of the remote future were strict vegetarians,
and while I was with them, in spite of some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed,
I found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the Ichthyosaurus into
extinction. But the fruits were very delightful; one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all
the time I was there--a floury thing in a three-sided husk --was especially good, and I made it my
staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but
later I began to perceive their import.
`However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now. So soon as my appetite
was a little checked, I determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new
men of mine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient thing to
begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures.
I had some considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare
of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to
grasp my intention and repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business at great
length to each other, and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language
caused an immense amount of amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,
and persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my command; and
then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb "to eat." But it was slow work, and the
little people soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather
of necessity, to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined. And very little
doses I found they were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more easily
fatigued.
`A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was their lack of interest. They
would come to me with eager cries of astonishment, like children, but like children they would
soon stop examining me and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my
conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almost all those who had
surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little
people. I went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was
satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men of the future, who would follow me a little
distance, chatter and laugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way,
leave me again to my own devices.
`The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great hall, and the scene was
lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At first things were very confusing. Everything was so
entirely different from the world I had known--even the flowers. The big building I had left was
situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its
present position. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest perhaps a mile and a half away,
from which I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two
Thousand Seven Hundred and One A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little dials
15 / 49

https://www.fulltextarchive.comof my machine recorded.
`As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly help to explain the
condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the world--for ruinous it was. A little way up the
hill, for instance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vast
labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very
beautiful pagoda-like plants--nettles possibly--but wonderfully tinted with brown about the
leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure, to
what end built I could not determine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have a
very strange experience--the first intimation of a still stranger discovery--but of that I will speak
in its proper place.
`Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested for a while, I realized
that there were no small houses to be seen. Apparently the single house, and possibly even the
household, had vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings, but
the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features of our own English
landscape, had disappeared.
`"Communism," said I to myself.
`And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the half-dozen little figures that were
following me. Then, in a flash, I perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft
hairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange, perhaps, that I had
not noticed this before. But everything was so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In
costume, and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each
other, these people of the future were alike. And the children seemed to my eyes to be but the
miniatures of their parents. I judged, then, that the children of that time were extremely
precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion.
`Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt that this close
resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect; for the strength of a man and
the softness of a woman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are
mere militant necessities of an age of physical force; where population is balanced and
abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where
violence comes but rarely and off-spring are secure, there is less necessity--indeed there is no
necessity--for an efficient family, and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their
children's needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even in our own time, and in this
future age it was complete. This, I must remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I
was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality.
`While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure,
like a well under a cupola. I thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and
then resumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towards the top of
the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous, I was presently left alone for the
first time. With a strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.
`There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize, corroded in places with a
kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the
resemblance of griffins' heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of our old world

https://www.fulltextarchive.comindifferent and unseeing. The black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep descending grade,
its aperture adorned with grotesquely chiselled jambs and lintel. From that cryptical mouth we
fancied a current of slightly warmer air and perhaps even a suspicion of vapour proceeded; and
we wondered what living entities other than penguins the limitless void below, and the
contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains, might conceal. We wondered,
too, whether the trace of mountain-top smoke at first suspected by poor Lake, as well as the
odd haze we had ourselves perceived around the rampart-crowned peak, might not be caused
by the tortuous-channelled rising of some such vapour from the unfathomed regions of earth’s
core.
Entering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was—at least at the start—about fifteen feet each way;
sides, floor, and arched roof composed of the usual megalithic masonry. The sides were
sparsely decorated with cartouches of conventional designs in a late, decadent style; and all the
construction and carving were marvellously well preserved. The floor was quite clear, except for
a slight detritus bearing outgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of those others. The
farther one advanced, the warmer it became; so that we were soon unbuttoning our heavy
garments. We wondered whether there were any actually igneous manifestations below, and
whether the waters of that sunless sea were hot. After a short distance the masonry gave place
to solid rock, though the tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same aspect of
carved regularity. Occasionally its varying grade became so steep that grooves were cut in the
floor. Several times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not recorded in our diagrams;
none of them such as to complicate the problem of our return, and all of them welcome as
possible refuges in case we met unwelcome entities on their way back from the abyss. The
nameless scent of such things was very distinct. Doubtless it was suicidally foolish to venture
into that tunnel under the known conditions, but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain
persons than most suspect—indeed, it was just such a lure which had brought us to this
unearthly polar waste in the first place. We saw several penguins as we passed along, and
speculated on the distance we would have to traverse. The carvings had led us to expect a
steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss, but our previous wanderings had shewn us
that matters of scale were not wholly to be depended on.
After about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly accentuated, and we kept
very careful track of the various lateral openings we passed. There was no visible vapour as at
the mouth, but this was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting cooler air. The temperature was
rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come upon a careless heap of material
shudderingly familiar to us. It was composed of furs and tent-cloth taken from Lake’s camp, and
we did not pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been slashed. Slightly
beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and number of the side-galleries,
and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now
have been reached. The nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely
less offensive odour—of what nature we could not guess, though we thought of decaying
organisms and perhaps unknown subterrene fungi. Then came a startling expansion of the
tunnel for which the carvings had not prepared us—a broadening and rising into a lofty, natural-
looking elliptical cavern with a level floor; some 75 feet long and 50 broad, and with many
immense side-passages leading away into cryptical darkness.

https://www.fulltextarchive.comThough this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both torches suggested that it
had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls between adjacent honeycombings.
The walls were rough, and the high vaulted roof was thick with stalactites; but the solid rock
floor had been smoothed off, and was free from all debris, detritus, or even dust to a positively
abnormal extent. Except for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of the floors
of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the singularity of the condition was such as to
set us vainly puzzling. The curious new foetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was
excessively pungent here; so much so that it destroyed all trace of the other. Something about
this whole place, with its polished and almost glistening floor, struck us as more vaguely baffling
and horrible than any of the monstrous things we had previously encountered.
The regularity of the passage immediately ahead, as well as the larger proportion of penguin-
droppings there, prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally
great cave-mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trail-blazing if any further
complexity should develop; for dust tracks, of course, could no longer be expected. Upon
resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the tunnel walls—and stopped
short in amazement at the supremely radical change which had come over the carvings in this
part of the passage. We realised, of course, the great decadence of the Old Ones’ sculpture at
the time of the tunnelling; and had indeed noticed the inferior workmanship of the arabesques in
the stretches behind us. But now, in this deeper section beyond the cavern, there was a sudden
difference wholly transcending explanation—a difference in basic nature as well as in mere
quality, and involving so profound and calamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in the
hitherto observed rate of decline could have led one to expect it.
This new and degenerate work was coarse, bold, and wholly lacking in delicacy of detail. It was
counter-sunk with exaggerated depth in bands following the same general line as the sparse
cartouches of the earlier sections, but the height of the reliefs did not reach the level of the
general surface. Danforth had the idea that it was a second carving—a sort of palimpsest formed
after the obliteration of a previous design. In nature it was wholly decorative and conventional;
and consisted of crude spirals and angles roughly following the quintile mathematical tradition of
the Old Ones, yet seeming more like a parody than a perpetuation of that tradition. We could
not get it out of our minds that some subtly but profoundly alien element had been added to the
aesthetic feeling behind the technique—an alien element, Danforth guessed, that was
responsible for the manifestly laborious substitution. It was like, yet disturbingly unlike, what we
had come to recognise as the Old Ones’ art; and I was persistently reminded of such hybrid
things as the ungainly Palmyrene sculptures fashioned in the Roman manner. That others had
recently noticed this belt of carving was hinted by the presence of a used torch battery on the
floor in front of one of the most characteristic designs.
Since we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we resumed our advance
after a cursory look; though frequently casting beams over the walls to see if any further

https://www.fulltextarchive.comso, where were they? Were they close at hand and likely to form an immediate menace to us?
We glanced anxiously at some of the smooth-floored lateral passages as we continued our slow
and frankly reluctant approach. Whatever the conflict was, it had clearly been that which had
frightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering. It must, then, have arisen near that
faintly heard rookery in the incalculable gulf beyond, since there were no signs that any birds
had normally dwelt here. Perhaps, we reflected, there had been a hideous running fight, with
the weaker party seeking to get back to the cached sledges when their pursuers finished them.
One could picture the daemoniac fray between namelessly monstrous entities as it surged out
of the black abyss with great clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying ahead.
I say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions slowly and reluctantly.
Would to heaven we had never approached them at all, but had run back at top speed out of
that blasphemous tunnel with the greasily smooth floors and the degenerate murals aping and
mocking the things they had superseded—run back, before we had seen what we did see, and
before our minds were burned with something which will never let us breathe easily again!
Both of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects, so that we soon realised the dominant
factor in their incompleteness. Mauled, compressed, twisted, and ruptured as they were, their
chief common injury was total decapitation. From each one the tentacled starfish-head had
been removed; and as we drew near we saw that the manner of removal looked more like some
hellish tearing or suction than like any ordinary form of cleavage. Their noisome dark-green
ichor formed a large, spreading pool; but its stench was half overshadowed by that newer and
stranger stench, here more pungent than at any other point along our route. Only when we had
come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we trace that second, unexplainable foetor
to any immediate source—and the instant we did so Danforth, remembering certain very vivid
sculptures of the Old Ones’ history in the Permian age 150 million years ago, gave vent to a
nerve-tortured cry which echoed hysterically through that vaulted and archaic passage with the
evil palimpsest carvings.
I came only just short of echoing his cry myself; for I had seen those primal sculptures, too, and
had shudderingly admired the way the nameless artist had suggested that hideous slime-
coating found on certain incomplete and prostrate Old Ones—those whom the frightful shoggoths
had characteristically slain and sucked to a ghastly headlessness in the great war of re-
subjugation. They were infamous, nightmare sculptures even when telling of age-old, bygone
things; for shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by human beings or portrayed by any
beings. The mad author of the Necronomicon had nervously tried to swear that none had been
bred on this planet, and that only drugged dreamers had ever conceived them. Formless
protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms and organs and processes—viscous agglutinations
of bubbling cells—rubbery fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic and ductile—slaves of
suggestion, builders of cities—more and more sullen, more and more intelligent, more and more
amphibious, more and more imitative—Great God! What madness made even those
blasphemous Old Ones willing to use and to carve such things?

https://www.fulltextarchive.comThe new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided; because it was what
poor Lake’s dissection had led us to attribute to those we had just judged dead. It was,
Danforth later told me, precisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that spot
beyond the alley-corner above the glacial level; and it certainly had a shocking resemblance to
the wind-pipings we had both heard around the lofty mountain caves. At the risk of seeming
puerile I will add another thing, too; if only because of the surprising way Danforth’s impression
chimed with mine. Of course common reading is what prepared us both to make the
interpretation, though Danforth has hinted at queer notions about unsuspected and forbidden
sources to which Poe may have had access when writing his Arthur Gordon Pym a century ago.
It will be remembered that in that fantastic tale there is a word of unknown but terrible and
prodigious significance connected with the antarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic,
spectrally snowy birds of that malign region’s core. “Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!” That, I may admit, is
exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden sound behind the advancing white
mist—that insidious musical piping over a singularly wide range.
We were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been uttered, though we knew that the
swiftness of the Old Ones would enable any scream-roused and pursuing survivor of the
slaughter to overtake us in a moment if it really wished to do so. We had a vague hope,
however, that non-aggressive conduct and a display of kindred reason might cause such a
being to spare us in case of capture; if only from scientific curiosity. After all, if such an one had
nothing to fear for itself it would have no motive in harming us. Concealment being futile at this
juncture, we used our torch for a running glance behind, and perceived that the mist was
thinning. Would we see, at last, a complete and living specimen of those others? Again came
that insidious musical piping—“Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”
Then, noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer, it occurred to us that the entity might
be wounded. We could take no chances, however, since it was very obviously approaching in
answer to Danforth’s scream rather than in flight from any other entity. The timing was too
close to admit of doubt. Of the whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable
nightmare—that foetid, unglimpsed mountain of slime-spewing protoplasm whose race had
conquered the abyss and sent land pioneers to re-carve and squirm through the burrows of the
hills—we could form no guess; and it cost us a genuine pang to leave this probably crippled Old
One—perhaps a lone survivor—to the peril of recapture and a nameless fate.
Thank heaven we did not slacken our run. The curling mist had thickened again, and was
driving ahead with increased speed; whilst the straying penguins in our rear were squawking
and screaming and displaying signs of a panic really surprising in view of their relatively minor
confusion when we had passed them. Once more came that sinister, wide-ranged
piping—“Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!” We had been wrong. The thing was not wounded, but had merely
paused on encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the hellish slime inscription above
them. We could never know what that daemon message was—but those burials at Lake’s camp
had shewn how much importance the beings attached to their dead. Our recklessly used torch
now revealed ahead of us the large open cavern where various ways converged, and we were

https://www.fulltextarchive.comswept so evilly free of all litter. Still came that eldritch, mocking cry—“Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!” And at
last we remembered that the daemoniac shoggoths—given life, thought, and plastic organ
patterns solely by the Old Ones, and having no language save that which the dot-groups
expressed—had likewise no voice save the imitated accents of their bygone masters.
XII.
Danforth and I have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured hemisphere and of
threading our back trail through the Cyclopean rooms and corridors of the dead city; yet these
are purely dream-fragments involving no memory of volition, details, or physical exertion. It was
as if we floated in a nebulous world or dimension without time, causation, or orientation. The
grey half-daylight of the vast circular space sobered us somewhat; but we did not go near those
cached sledges or look again at poor Gedney and the dog. They have a strange and titanic
mausoleum, and I hope the end of this planet will find them still undisturbed.
It was while struggling up the colossal spiral incline that we first felt the terrible fatigue and short
breath which our race through the thin plateau air had produced; but not even the fear of
collapse could make us pause before reaching the normal outer realm of sun and sky. There
was something vaguely appropriate about our departure from those buried epochs; for as we
wound our panting way up the sixty-foot cylinder of primal masonry we glimpsed beside us a
continuous procession of heroic sculptures in the dead race’s early and undecayed
technique—a farewell from the Old Ones, written fifty million years ago.
Finally scrambling out at the top, we found ourselves on a great mound of tumbled blocks; with
the curved walls of higher stonework rising westward, and the brooding peaks of the great
mountains shewing beyond the more crumbled structures toward the east. The low antarctic sun
of midnight peered redly from the southern horizon through rifts in the jagged ruins, and the
terrible age and deadness of the nightmare city seemed all the starker by contrast with such
relatively known and accustomed things as the features of the polar landscape. The sky above
was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous ice-vapours, and the cold clutched at our
vitals. Wearily resting the outfit-bags to which we had instinctively clung throughout our
desperate flight, we rebuttoned our heavy garments for the stumbling climb down the mound
and the walk through the aeon-old stone maze to the foothills where our aëroplane waited. Of
what had set us fleeing from the darkness of earth’s secret and archaic gulfs we said nothing at
all.
In less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the foothills—the probable
ancient terrace—by which we had descended, and could see the dark bulk of our great plane
71 / 74

https://www.fulltextarchive.comamidst the sparse ruins on the rising slope ahead. Half way uphill toward our goal we paused for
a momentary breathing-spell, and turned to look again at the fantastic palaeogean tangle of
incredible stone shapes below us—once more outlined mystically against an unknown west. As
we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its morning haziness; the restless ice-vapours
having moved up to the zenith, where their mocking outlines seemed on the point of settling into
some bizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or conclusive.
There now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind the grotesque city a dim, elfin line
of pinnacled violet whose needle-pointed heights loomed dream-like against the beckoning rose-
colour of the western sky. Up toward this shimmering rim sloped the ancient table-land, the
depressed course of the bygone river traversing it as an irregular ribbon of shadow. For a
second we gasped in admiration of the scene’s unearthly cosmic beauty, and then vague
horror began to creep into our souls. For this far violet line could be nothing else than the
terrible mountains of the forbidden land—highest of earth’s peaks and focus of earth’s evil;
harbourers of nameless horrors and Archaean secrets; shunned and prayed to by those who
feared to carve their meaning; untrodden by any living thing of earth, but visited by the sinister
lightnings and sending strange beams across the plains in the polar night—beyond doubt the
unknown archetype of that dreaded Kadath in the Cold Waste beyond abhorrent Leng, whereof
unholy primal legends hint evasively. We were the first human beings ever to see them—and I
hope to God we may be the last.
If the sculptured maps and pictures in that pre-human city had told truly, these cryptic violet
mountains could not be much less than 300 miles away; yet none the less sharply did their dim
elfin essence jut above that remote and snowy rim, like the serrated edge of a monstrous alien
planet about to rise into unaccustomed heavens. Their height, then, must have been
tremendous beyond all known comparison—carrying them up into tenuous atmospheric strata
peopled by such gaseous wraiths as rash flyers have barely lived to whisper of after
unexplainable falls. Looking at them, I thought nervously of certain sculptured hints of what the
great bygone river had washed down into the city from their accursed slopes—and wondered
how much sense and how much folly had lain in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them
so reticently. I recalled how their northerly end must come near the coast at Queen Mary Land,
where even at that moment Sir Douglas Mawson’s expedition was doubtless working less than
a thousand miles away; and hoped that no evil fate would give Sir Douglas and his men a
glimpse of what might lie beyond the protecting coastal range. Such thoughts formed a measure
of my overwrought condition at the time—and Danforth seemed to be even worse.
Yet long before we had passed the great star-shaped ruin and reached our plane our fears had
become transferred to the lesser but vast enough range whose re-crossing lay ahead of us.
From these foothills the black, ruin-crusted slopes reared up starkly and hideously against the
east, again reminding us of those strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich; and when we
thought of the damnable honeycombs inside them, and of the frightful amorphous entities that
might have pushed their foetidly squirming way even to the topmost hollow pinnacles, we could
not face without panic the prospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave-mouths

https://www.fulltextarchive.comwhere the wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range. To make matters
worse, we saw distinct traces of local mist around several of the summits—as poor Lake must
have done when he made that early mistake about volcanism—and thought shiveringly of that
kindred mist from which we had just escaped; of that, and of the blasphemous, horror-fostering
abyss whence all such vapours came.
All was well with the plane, and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying furs. Danforth got the
engine started without trouble, and we made a very smooth takeoff over the nightmare city.
Below us the primal Cyclopean masonry spread out as it had done when first we saw it—so
short, yet infinitely long, a time ago—and we began rising and turning to test the wind for our
crossing through the pass. At a very high level there must have been great disturbance, since
the ice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all sorts of fantastic things; but at 24,000 feet, the
height we needed for the pass, we found navigation quite practicable. As we drew close to the
jutting peaks the wind’s strange piping again became manifest, and I could see Danforth’s
hands trembling at the controls. Rank amateur though I was, I thought at that moment that I
might be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing between pinnacles; and
when I made motions to change seats and take over his duties he did not protest. I tried to keep
all my skill and self-possession about me, and stared at the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt
the walls of the pass—resolutely refusing to pay attention to the puffs of mountain-top vapour,
and wishing that I had wax-stopped ears like Ulysses’ men off the Sirens’ coast to keep that
disturbing wind-piping from my consciousness.
But Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous nervous pitch, could not
keep quiet. I felt him turning and wriggling about as he looked back at the terrible receding city,
ahead at the cave-riddled, cube-barnacled peaks, sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy, rampart-
strown foothills, and upward at the seething, grotesquely clouded sky. It was then, just as I was
trying to steer safely through the pass, that his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster by
shattering my tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the controls for a
moment. A second afterward my resolution triumphed and we made the crossing safely—yet I
am afraid that Danforth will never be the same again.
I have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream out so
insanely—a horror which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly responsible for his present breakdown. We
had snatches of shouted conversation above the wind’s piping and the engine’s buzzing as we
reached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the camp, but that had
mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare
city. Certain things, we had agreed, were not for people to know and discuss lightly—and I would
not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that Starkweather-Moore Expedition, and
others, at any cost. It is absolutely necessary, for the peace and safety of mankind, that some of
earth’s dark, dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone; lest sleeping abnormalities
wake to resurgent life, and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out of their
black lairs to newer and wider conquests.

https://www.fulltextarchive.comAll that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage. It was not, he declares,
anything connected with the cubes and caves of echoing, vaporous, wormily honeycombed
mountains of madness which we crossed; but a single fantastic, daemoniac glimpse, among the
churning zenith-clouds, of what lay back of those other violet westward mountains which the Old
Ones had shunned and feared. It is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born of
the previous stresses we had passed through, and of the actual though unrecognised mirage of
the dead transmontane city experienced near Lake’s camp the day before; but it was so real to
Danforth that he suffers from it still.
He has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things about “the black pit”,
“the carven rim”, “the proto-shoggoths”, “the windowless solids with five dimensions”, “the
nameless cylinder”, “the elder pharos”, “Yog-Sothoth”, “the primal white jelly”, “the colour out
of space”, “the wings”, “the eyes in darkness”, “the moon-ladder”, “the original, the eternal,
the undying”, and other bizarre conceptions; but when he is fully himself he repudiates all this
and attributes it to his curious and macabre reading of earlier years. Danforth, indeed, is known
to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through that worm-riddled copy of the
Necronomicon kept under lock and key in the college library.
The higher sky, as we crossed the range, was surely vaporous and disturbed enough; and
although I did not see the zenith I can well imagine that its swirls of ice-dust may have taken
strange forms. Imagination, knowing how vividly distant scenes can sometimes be reflected,
refracted, and magnified by such layers of restless cloud, might easily have supplied the
rest—and of course Danforth did not hint any of those specific horrors till after his memory had
had a chance to draw on his bygone reading. He could never have seen so much in one
instantaneous glance.
At the time his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single mad word of all too obvious
source:
“Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”

I.
I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without
knowing why. It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for opposing this
contemplated invasion of the antarctic—with its vast fossil-hunt and its wholesale boring and
melting of the ancient ice-cap—and I am the more reluctant because my warning may be in vain.
Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet if I suppressed what will seem
extravagant and incredible there would be nothing left. The hitherto withheld photographs, both
ordinary and aërial, will count in my favour; for they are damnably vivid and graphic. Still, they
will be doubted because of the great lengths to which clever fakery can be carried. The ink
drawings, of course, will be jeered at as obvious impostures; notwithstanding a strangeness of
technique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle over.
In the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few scientific leaders who have, on
the one hand, sufficient independence of thought to weigh my data on its own hideously
convincing merits or in the light of certain primordial and highly baffling myth-cycles; and on the
other hand, sufficient influence to deter the exploring world in general from any rash and
overambitious programme in the region of those mountains of madness. It is an unfortunate fact
that relatively obscure men like myself and my associates, connected only with a small
university, have little chance of making an impression where matters of a wildly bizarre or highly
controversial nature are concerned.

https://www.fulltextarchive.comIt is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, specialists in the fields which came
primarily to be concerned. As a geologist my object in leading the Miskatonic University
Expedition was wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from various parts
of the antarctic continent, aided by the remarkable drill devised by Prof. Frank H. Pabodie of our
engineering department. I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this; but I did hope
that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points along previously explored paths
would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection.
Pabodie’s drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our reports, was unique and
radical in its lightness, portability, and capacity to combine the ordinary artesian drill principle
with the principle of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope quickly with strata of
varying hardness. Steel head, jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick,
dynamiting paraphernalia, cording, rubbish-removal auger, and sectional piping for bores five
inches wide and up to 1000 feet deep all formed, with needed accessories, no greater load than
three seven-dog sledges could carry; this being made possible by the clever aluminum alloy of
which most of the metal objects were fashioned. Four large Dornier aëroplanes, designed
especially for the tremendous altitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added
fuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could transport our entire
expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier to various suitable inland points, and
from these points a sufficient quota of dogs would serve us.
We planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic season—or longer, if absolutely
necessary—would permit, operating mostly in the mountain-ranges and on the plateau south of
Ross Sea; regions explored in varying degree by Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd. With
frequent changes of camp, made by aëroplane and involving distances great enough to be of
geological significance, we expected to unearth a quite unprecedented amount of material;
especially in the pre-Cambrian strata of which so narrow a range of antarctic specimens had
previously been secured. We wished also to obtain as great as possible a variety of the upper
fossiliferous rocks, since the primal life-history of this bleak realm of ice and death is of the
highest importance to our knowledge of the earth’s past. That the antarctic continent was once
temperate and even tropical, with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the lichens,
marine fauna, arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge are the only survivals, is a matter
of common information; and we hoped to expand that information in variety, accuracy, and
detail. When a simple boring revealed fossiliferous signs, we would enlarge the aperture by
blasting in order to get specimens of suitable size and condition.
Our borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper soil or rock, were
to be confined to exposed or nearly exposed land surfaces—these inevitably being slopes and
ridges because of the mile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels. We could
not afford to waste drilling depth on any considerable amount of mere glaciation, though
Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and
melting off limited areas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven dynamo. It is this plan—which
we could not put into effect except experimentally on an expedition such as ours—that the
coming Starkweather-Moore Expedition proposes to follow despite the warnings I have issued
since our return from the antarctic.

Upon an eroded cliff-top rested the man, gazing far across the valley. Lying thus, he could see a
great distance, but in all the sere expanse there was no visible motion. Nothing stirred the dusty
plain, the disintegrated sand of long-dry river-beds, where once coursed the gushing streams of
Earth’s youth. There was little greenery in this ultimate world, this final stage of mankind’s
prolonged presence upon the planet. For unnumbered aeons the drought and sandstorms had
ravaged all the lands. The trees and bushes had given way to small, twisted shrubs that
persisted long through their sturdiness; but these, in turn, perished before the onslaught of
coarse grasses and stringy, tough vegetation of strange evolution.
The ever-present heat, as Earth drew nearer to the sun, withered and killed with pitiless rays. It
had not come at once; long aeons had gone before any could feel the change. And all through
those first ages man’s adaptable form had followed the slow mutation and modelled itself to fit
the more and more torrid air. Then the day had come when men could bear their hot cities but
ill, and a gradual recession began, slow yet deliberate. Those towns and settlements closest to
the equator had been first, of course, but later there were others. Man, softened and exhausted,
could cope no longer with the ruthlessly mounting heat. It seared him as he was, and evolution
was too slow to mould new resistances in him.
Yet not at first were the great cities of the equator left to the spider and the scorpion. In the early
years there were many who stayed on, devising curious shields and armours against the heat
and the deadly dryness. These fearless souls, screening certain buildings against the
encroaching sun, made miniature worlds of refuge wherein no protective armour was needed.
They contrived marvellously ingenious things, so that for a while men persisted in the rusting
towers, hoping thereby to cling to old lands till the searing should be over. For many would not
believe what the astronomers said, and looked for a coming of the mild olden world again. But
one day the men of Dath, from the new city of Niyara, made signals to Yuanario, their
immemorially ancient capital, and gained no answer from the few who remained therein. And
when explorers reached that millennial city of bridge-linked towers they found only silence.
There was not even the horror of corruption, for the scavenger lizards had been swift.
Only then did the people fully realize that these cities were lost to them; know that they must
forever abandon them to nature. The other colonists in the hot lands fled from their brave posts,
and total silence reigned within the high basalt walls of a thousand empty towns. Of the dense
throngs and multitudinous activities of the past, nothing finally remained. There now loomed
against the rainless deserts only the blistered towers of vacant houses, factories, and structures
of every sort, reflecting the sun’s dazzling radiance and parching in the more and more
intolerable heat.

https://www.fulltextarchive.comMany lands, however, had still escaped the scorching blight, so that the refugees were soon
absorbed in the life of a newer world. During strangely prosperous centuries the hoary deserted
cities of the equator grew half-forgotten and entwined with fantastic fables. Few thought of those
spectral, rotting towers . . . those huddles of shabby walls and cactus-choked streets, darkly
silent and abandoned. . . .
Wars came, sinful and prolonged, but the times of peace were greater. Yet always the swollen
sun increased its radiance as Earth drew closer to its fiery parent. It was as if the planet meant
to return to that source whence it was snatched, aeons ago, through the accidents of cosmic
growth.
After a time the blight crept outward from the central belt. Southern Yarat burned as a
tenantless desert—and then the north. In Perath and Baling, those ancient cities where brooding
centuries dwelt, there moved only the scaly shapes of the serpent and the salamander, and at
last Loton echoed only to the fitful falling of tottering spires and crumbling domes.
Steady, universal, and inexorable was the great eviction of man from the realms he had always
known. No land within the widening stricken belt was spared; no people left unrouted. It was an
epic, a titan tragedy whose plot was unrevealed to the actors—this wholesale desertion of the
cities of men. It took not years or even centuries, but millennia of ruthless change. And still it
kept on—sullen, inevitable, savagely devastating.
Agriculture was at a standstill, the world fast became too arid for crops. This was remedied by
artificial substitutes, soon universally used. And as the old places that had known the great
things of mortals were left, the loot salvaged by the fugitives grew smaller and smaller. Things of
the greatest value and importance were left in dead museums—lost amid the centuries—and in
the end the heritage of the immemorial past was abandoned. A degeneracy both physical and
cultural set in with the insidious heat. For man had so long dwelt in comfort and security that this
exodus from past scenes was difficult. Nor were these events received phlegmatically; their very
slowness was terrifying. Degradation and debauchery were soon common; government was
disorganized, and the civilizations aimlessly slid back toward barbarism.
When, forty-nine centuries after the blight from the equatorial belt, the whole western
hemisphere was left unpeopled, chaos was complete. There was no trace of order or decency in
the last scenes of this titanic, wildly impressive migration. Madness and frenzy stalked through
them, and fanatics screamed of an Armageddon close at hand.

VERSION 3.1.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN adds requirements for COVID-19 testing prior to 
international travel, in line with reference (a), to include testing prior to 
entry into the U.S. from a foreign country, as described in references (b) 
through (e).  Reference (a) is cancelled.

2.  The dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic requires the implementation 
of measures to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spread.
Many countries, to include the U.S., now require negative test results before 
arrival.  In line with reference (c), and to ensure Service Members and 
families are not refused travel or delayed, all travelers executing 
international orders, to include returning to the U.S. from a foreign 
country, are required to have a negative viral COVID-19 test (molecular or 
antigen).  An antigen test may be used for testing prior to travel when a 
molecular test (such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Abbott ID NOW) is 
not available.
However, a molecular test is the preferred test prior to travel.  If the 
destination location requires a specific test, test timing, or test result 
format, travelers must follow the stricter requirement.
3.  Service Members and/or family members must do the following
    a.  Possess, and present on request, proof of a negative viral COVID-19 
test administered within 72 hours of embarkation for international travel for 
each traveling family member.  Valid proof may be electronic or printed for 
commercial flights.  Printed proof will be requested prior to Air Mobility 
Command (AMC) Patriot Express (PE) (i.e., rotator) or Military aircraft 
flights.
Travelers should verify specific country entry requirements to avoid delays, 
fines, or other complications upon arrival.
Note:  If previously infected with COVID-19, a molecular COVID-19 test may 
still produce a positive result.  If unable to achieve a negative result, 
consult with a medical provider, the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), and/or 
your travel provider to determine the necessary medical clearance 
documentation.  Documents likely include the proof of COVID-19 positive 
results, written documentation from the treating physician that the traveler 
has recovered, and the date of the onset of symptoms or positive test.
    b.  Review the FCG (https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/Fcg.cfm) to determine 
the exact entry requirements for the final destination (does not apply to 
routine intermediate stops).  COVID-19 travel information for travelers 
returning to the United States may be found on the Department of State 
website (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/
en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html).  Additionally, travelers 
are encouraged to register for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program 
(https://step.state.gov) for a free service enabling travelers to enroll 
their trip with the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.  This service provides 
updates from the embassy regarding travel requirements and safety conditions 
in the destination country.
    c.  Review associated destination requirements, such as type of test, 
timing or test result format, to determine specifics for entry that may be 
more restrictive than service policy, e.g., testing within 72 hours from 
arrival instead of embarkation - in this case, travelers must execute their 
testing in order to arrive at their embarkation site with proof and have 
sufficient time remaining to travel to their destination prior to the 
requirement expiring.
    d.  Plan intermediate travel and leave.  Do not place you and your family 
in extremis should an unexpected restriction of movement (ROM) be required 
while traveling prior to embarkation.  During trip planning, ensure you 
identify facilities along your route of travel that will accommodate you or a 
family member who may become COVID-19 positive.  Additionally, financially 
plan for an extended trip and/or additional tests should they become 
necessary.  Service Members are encouraged to use their Government Travel 
Charge Card (GTCC) for travel expenses on official orders as this will assist 
in alleviating personal financial impact.  TRICARE covers COVID-19 tests when 
medically necessary and appropriate.  Visit: 
https://www.tricare.mil/covid19testing for more details on COVID-19 testing 
coverage.  TRICARE does not fund strictly travel-based tests.  If not using a 
military facility, Service Members traveling on official orders should be 
prepared to pay for tests and be refunded via travel claim, in line with the 
Joint Travel Regulations.  For those that choose not to use the GTCC or do 
not possess a GTCC, advanced travel pay is encouraged since molecular-based 
tests may be expensive.  If paying for a commercial test that requires an 
upfront fee (copay), Service Members should ensure to submit the full testing 
cost via travel claim.
    e.  Take responsibility for testing.  The service is providing the 
following options to assist with individual travel situations, but it is the 
responsibility of the traveler to ensure all requirements have been met:
        (1) When traveling internationally from the U.S.:
            (a) Military treatment facilities (MTF) will execute free tests 
for Service Members and dependents in possession of international orders in 
line with reference (c).  Tests should be scheduled prior to arrival at the 
MTF.  MTFs should deliver hard copy documentation of test results within 24 
hours of testing to the Service Members and dependents.  This allows for 
testing in a different area than former duty stations to account for leave or 
training in route.  A non-inclusive list of preferred MTFs may be found on 
the Overseas PCS COVID-19 Testing Fact Sheet via the MyNavy Portal 
(https://www.mnp.navy.mil/covid-19.html).
Note:  Most MTFs are closed during the weekend and holidays.
Travelers are encouraged to plan for alternate testing solutions if boarding 
a flight at the beginning of the week.
            (b)  Travelers assigned to a U.S. Transportation Command
(USTRANSCOM)/AMC PE flight (i.e., rotator) may be tested at the Madigan Army 
Medical Center (Seattle) or Walter Reed National Military Medical Center 
(Bethesda) if travel timing precludes testing prior to arriving at the PE 
terminal.  If using this option, travelers should appear in person 48 hours 
prior to boarding at their respective Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE).  
Walk-up testing is located in temporary shelters outside the facilities.  
Direct communication with the testing sites is limited.  Applicable contact 
information as follows:
                i.   AMC Gateway, Baltimore, MD:
                     Phone - (609) 253-8825
                     Schedule - Limited operations
                ii.  Walter Reed National Military Medical Center,
                     Bethesda, MD:
                     Phone  (Central Screening) (571) 335-9985
                     Schedule - 0700-1600 EST, no weekends or
                                holidays
                iii. AMC Gateway, Seattle, WA:
                     Phone - (253) 982-3504/0555
                     Schedule - Limited operations.
                iv.  Madigan Army Medical Center, McChord, WA:
                     Phone  (PrevMed) (253) 968-4443
                     Schedule - 0600-1700 PST, weekends/no holidays
            (c) Commercial sites that support antigen or molecular-based 
tests (e.g., PCR and Abbott ID NOW) may be used to satisfy the requirement.  
See planning and cost considerations above.
        (2) When traveling to the U.S. from a foreign country:
            (a) Travelers returning to the U.S. should primarily use their 
closest U.S. installation MTF.  COVID-19 testing results will be available 
via TRICARE Online, often within 24 hours of testing.
Results may be printed, if hard copies are required.  A list of preferred 
international MTFs may be found on the Overseas PCS COVID-19 Testing Fact 
Sheet via the MyNavy Portal (https://www.mnp.navy.mil/covid-19.html).
            (b) International commercial sites that support antigen or 
molecular-based tests may also be used to satisfy the requirement.  However, 
travelers should consult with their local installation, military liaison, or 
U.S. Embassy prior to doing so. See planning and cost considerations above.
    f.  Travelers that test positive for COVID-19 while executing 
international travel must do the following:
        (1) Immediately execute ROM procedures.  If a member of a family unit 
tests positive, the entire family unit must commence ROM.  Travelers may not 
proceed separately.  If not already in place at suitable lodging, priority 
for ROM site should be given to the following in order:  1) APOE, 2) home or 
detaching installation, 3) nearby family member, 4) nearby acceptable 
military installation and 5) nearby acceptable hotel.  Call ahead to the 
preferred ROM site for notification and support.  If no ROM site is available 
and additional support is required, call the MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) 
contact information below.  If at a U.S. PE APOE, USTRANSCOM/AMC will take 
immediate responsibility for the travelers, to include medical, lodging, pet 
services, meals and transportation support.
AMC will direct travelers to nearby military installations or participating 
lodging sites.  While in ROM, travelers must strictly adhere to force 
protection health guidance and return to work criteria, in line with 
reference (f).  Do not proceed until consulting with your detailer and/or AMC 
(if at a U.S. PE APOE).
        (2) Contact the MNCC for initial notification and additional support.  
Available 24/7, by phone at 1-833-330-MNCC (6622) or email at 
askmncc(at)navy.mil.  Provide valid contact information and proof of positive 
test result(s) to the servicing MNCC agent.  The servicing MNCC agent will 
take appropriate action to notify the Service Member detailer, Navy Passenger 
Transportation Office (NAVPTO), and the OPNAV COVID-19 Taskforce Liaison.
        (3) Continue communicating with your detailer and NAVPTO agent for 
orders modification (ORDMOD) and logistics support.  Upon notification from 
the MNCC, the detailer and NAVPTO agent will contact the Service Member to 
discuss an ORDMOD and re-book future travel.  ORDMODs will ensure per diem is 
available and reimbursable for qualified expenses incurred during the ROM 
period.  Service Members may use the GTCC if issued.  Additionally, Service 
Members may request a travel advance through the MNCC regardless of GTCC 
possession.
        (4) Secure from ROM.  Once the travelers meet return to work 
criteria, in line with reference (f) and in conjunction with any medical 
provider guidance, they may continue execution of their orders after 
conferring with detailers and/or AMC (if at a U.S. PE APOE).  Service Members 
and detailers should be proactive to continue travel as soon as possible.

4.  Command Pay and Personnel Administrators must do the following before a 
Service Member detaches:
    a.  Notify Service Member of the testing requirement for international 
travel and options.  Keep a record of the plans of the Service Member for 
testing, to include the intended facility site and date.
    b.  Counsel Service Members on the expense for commercial testing and 
discuss options for the potential financial burden, e.g. GTCC, advanced 
travel pay, reimbursement, etc.
    c.  Ensure the Service Member has detaching command contact information 
in case additional support is needed during an intermediate ROM status.

5.  Travelers with valid proof of COVID-19 vaccination are currently not 
exempt from the testing requirement.

6.  Contact the MNCC with any questions, issues or to provide feedback at 
833-330-MNCC/6622 or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil.

		TESTING IMPLEMENTATIONS OF DES

ABSTRACT
--------

We present a simple way to test the correctness of a DES implementation:
Use the recurrence relation:

	X0      =       9474B8E8C73BCA7D (hexadecimal)

	X(i+1)  =       IF  (i is even)  THEN  E(Xi,Xi)  ELSE  D(Xi,Xi)

to compute a sequence of 64-bit values:  X0, X1, X2, ..., X16.  Here
E(X,K)  denotes the DES encryption of  X  using key  K, and  D(X,K)  denotes
the DES decryption of  X  using key  K.  If you obtain

	X16     =       1B1A2DDB4C642438

your implementation does not have any of the 36,568 possible single-fault 
errors described herein.


INTRODUCTION
------------

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) has been approved by a variety of 
organizations (e.g. the U.S. government) for use in cryptographic applications.
The DES algorithm was published by the National Bureau of Standards [FIPS46].

The National Bureau of Standards has an ongoing program to validate the 
correctness of hardware DES implementations.  Their testing procedure,
described in [Ga80a], consists of 291 fixed test cases followed by twelve
million randomly chosen test cases.  A hardware implementation of DES that 
passes this test is awarded a "Validation Certficate".  

The above testing procedure provides good evidence that the DES hardware was
correctly designed and functioning properly at the time of validation.  
However, the user of a DES implementation would like to maintain the currency
of this validation -- this would be "maintenance testing" in contrast
to the "validation" service provided by NBS.  The purpose of maintenance 
testing is to ensure that the DES implementation is still correct, i.e.
that no operational fault has appeared since the last time the the device 
was tested.  Also note that NBS's validation procedure only inspects single
instances of a hardware device; the user of a DES device wants to ensure that
his device is correctly functioning (even though the design is OK, the device
may have developed faults).

One way to perform maintenance testing is to use two or more separate
implementations and compare their results after each operation.  If they
ever differ, then one of the units has ceased to operate correctly.  The
difficulty with this approach is the cost of providing the redundant
implementation.  

If a redundant implementation is infeasible, then the implementation may
be testing by comparing its input-output behaviour with that of a correct
implementation.  This paper provides such a procedure.  

It is desired to have a relatively short test procedure, since the
maintenance testing may be taking place in parallel with ordinary operations,
and the cost of the test procedure may affect the unit's overall
efficiency.  The test specified in this paper only requires 16 DES operations.

It is desirable to have an effective test procedure, in the
sense that implementation errors are very likely to be caught.  The test
specified here will catch any of the 36,568 single-fault implementation
errors specified later on.  

We next specify the DES implementation and error model, and then describe 
the experimental results that yielded the proposed maintenance test.


DES IMPLEMENTATION
------------------

Our DES implementation follows the specifications for DES:

	DES(X,K,E)
		-- X is a 64-bit input value
		-- K is a 64-bit key
		-- E is TRUE if we are encrypting, else FALSE
	(1) Apply permutation IP to X, resulting in value LR (64 bits).
	(2) Apply selector PC1 to K, resulting in value CD (56 bits).
	(3) For ROUND = 1, 2, ..., 16:
		(3a) if E is TRUE then
			if SHIFTS[ROUND] = 1
			then apply permutation LSH1 to CD (in place).
			else apply permutation LSH2 to CD (in place).
		(3b) Apply selector PC2 to CD resulting in value KI (48 bits)
		(3c) If E is FALSE then
			if SHIFTS[17-ROUND] = 1 
			then apply permutation RSH1 to CD (in place).
			else apply permutation RSH2 to CD (in place).
		(3d) Apply selector E to LR, resulting in value RE (48 bits).
		(3e) XOR RE with KI, resulting in value RX (48 bits).
		(3f) Break RX into 8 6-bit blocks, and replace the i-th block
		     Yi with the result of looking up Yi in S-box i.  
		     Concatenate these 4-bit results together to get the 32-bit
		     value SOUT.
		(3g) Apply permutation P to SOUT resulting in value FOUT (32 
		     bits).
		(3h) Replace the left half of LR with the XOR of FOUT and the
		     left half of LR.
		(3i) If ROUND is not 16, apply permutation SWAP to LR (in
		     place).
	(4) Apply permutation IPINV to LR resulting in value OUT (64 bits).
	    Return OUT as the result of this DES operation.


This implementation makes uses of the following tables and functions (for 
the details of these tables see [FIPS46]):

	(1) Permutations and selectors: IP, PC1, PC2, LSH1, LSH2, RSH1, RSH2, 
					E, P, SWAP, IPINV.
	    Each permutation or selector Q has a length LENGTH(Q) and a range
	    1...RANGE(Q).  For permutations LENGTH(Q)=RANGE(Q).  As an example,
	    the selector PC2 = [14, 17, ..., 32] has length 48 and range 56,
	    while permutation SWAP = [33, 34, ..., 32] has length 64 and range
	    64.
	
	(2) The table SHIFTS = [1, 1, 2, ..., 1] of length 16 specifying the
	    number of left shifts of the key registers to perform during 
	    each round.
	
	(3) The XOR (exclusive-OR) functions used in steps (3e) and (3h), on
	    input vectors of lengths 48 and 32, respectively.
	
	(4) The S-box tables used in step (3f).



ERROR MODEL
-----------

We now describe our model of implementation errors.  We consider the following
set of single-fault errors:

	(1) "Wiring errors": For each permutation or selector Q, we consider
	    the possibility that each of the output elements might 
		-- be stuck at 0
		-- be stuck at 1
		-- incorrectly specify some other value in 1...RANGE(Q).
	    There are thus LENGTH(Q)*(RANGE(Q)+1) possible errors for Q.

		Permutation                                     Number
		or                                              of Possible
		Selector        LENGTH          RANGE           Errors 
		------------    -------         ------          -----------
		IP              64              64              4160
		PC1             56              64              3640
		PC2             48              56              2736
		LSH1            56              56              3192
		LSH2            56              56              3192
		RSH1            56              56              3192
		RHS2            56              56              3192
		E               48              32              1584
		P               32              32              1056
		SWAP            64              64              4160
		IPINV           64              64              4160
		-----------------------------------------------------------
		Total Number of Possible Wiring Errors........34,264

	(2) Shift Errors: For each of the 16 positions of the SHIFTS table,
	    one error possibility is that the table entry could be incorrectly
	    specified (i.e. specify a shift of 1 when a shift of two was
	    desired, or vice versa).

		Total Number of Possible Shifting Errors..........16

	(3) XOR errors: For each XOR gate (there are 48 used in step (3e)
	    and 32 used in step (3h)) the following errors are possible:
		-- stuck at 0
		-- stuck at 1
		-- producing the negation of the desired result.

		Total Number of Possible XOR Errors..............240

	(4) SBOX errors: For each of the 8 * 64 * 4 = 2048 bits of the S-box
	    tables, we consider the possibility that it might be incorrectly
	    stored (i.e. a 0 is stored instead of a 1, or vice versa).

		Total Number of Possible SBOX Errors............2048

	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	Total Number of Error Possibilities Considered........36,568

We note that since our implementation is iterative, an error possibility
that can affect one round of encryption can affect every round.  


DESIGN OF VALIDATION TEST
-------------------------

A simple iterative test was desired, so that the only storage
requirements were the desired starting value, the desired ending value, and
the number of DES iterations to perform.  Alternation of encryption and 
decryption was chosen in order to exercise both modes equally.  The initial 
value, X0 = 9474B8E8C73BCA7D (hexadecimal) was chosen with a short search,
in order to find a sequence that tested the S-box entries efficiently.
To generate a pseudo-random sequence of test values, the output of
one stage is used as both the key and data inputs for the next stage.
That is, the pseudo-random sequence is defined by:

	X0      =       9474B8E8C73BCA7D

	X(i+1)  =       E(Xi,Xi)        if i is even
	X(i+1)  =       D(Xi,Xi)        if i is odd

where E(X,K) denotes the encryption of the 64-bit value X with 64-bit key
K, and D(X,K) denotes the corresponding decryption.  Note that the key is
a 64-bit value as specified in [FIPS46]; the 8 "parity" bits are discarded by 
selector PC1.  

DES was implemented in software on an IBM PC.  The correctness of this
implementation was checked using the 291 fixed tests given in [Ga77]. 
The various error possibilities were implemented, and an experiment was
run to determine the least i such that comparing Xi to its expected value
detected all the proposed single-fault errors.  Note that only one comparison
is needed; it is not necessary to compare the intermediate results with their
expected values.  The following table was obtained:

	i       Xi                      Number of errors NOT detected
	--      ----------------        -----------------------------
	0       9474B8E8C73BCA7D        36,568

We conclude that at most 16 DES operations suffice to test the correctness
of a DES implementation, under our error model.

We note that the number of rounds required was determined by the S-box tests.
The other error types were all detected within at most 11 iterations.
The number of DES operations required here is 3 less than in the set of S-box
tests published by NBS[Ga77]; a short search discovered the given starting 
value.  We leave it as an open problem to devise a test which uses 
substantially fewer DES operations.

We note that the above test may not catch multiple faults, or faults other than
those described in this paper.

UTF-8 decoder capability and stress test
----------------------------------------

Markus Kuhn <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/> - 2015-08-28 - CC BY 4.0

This test file can help you examine, how your UTF-8 decoder handles
various types of correct, malformed, or otherwise interesting UTF-8
sequences. This file is not meant to be a conformance test. It does
not prescribe any particular outcome. Therefore, there is no way to
"pass" or "fail" this test file, even though the text does suggest a
preferable decoder behaviour at some places. Its aim is, instead, to
help you think about, and test, the behaviour of your UTF-8 decoder on a
systematic collection of unusual inputs. Experience so far suggests
that most first-time authors of UTF-8 decoders find at least one
serious problem in their decoder using this file.

The test lines below cover boundary conditions, malformed UTF-8
sequences, as well as correctly encoded UTF-8 sequences of Unicode code
points that should never occur in a correct UTF-8 file.

According to ISO 10646-1:2000, sections D.7 and 2.3c, a device
receiving UTF-8 shall interpret a "malformed sequence in the same way
that it interprets a character that is outside the adopted subset" and
"characters that are not within the adopted subset shall be indicated
to the user" by a receiving device. One commonly used approach in
UTF-8 decoders is to replace any malformed UTF-8 sequence by a
replacement character (U+FFFD), which looks a bit like an inverted
question mark, or a similar symbol. It might be a good idea to
visually distinguish a malformed UTF-8 sequence from a correctly
encoded Unicode character that is just not available in the current
font but otherwise fully legal, even though ISO 10646-1 doesn't
mandate this. In any case, just ignoring malformed sequences or
unavailable characters does not conform to ISO 10646, will make
debugging more difficult, and can lead to user confusion.

Please check, whether a malformed UTF-8 sequence is (1) represented at
all, (2) represented by exactly one single replacement character (or
equivalent signal), and (3) the following quotation mark after an
illegal UTF-8 sequence is correctly displayed, i.e. proper
resynchronization takes place immediately after any malformed
sequence. This file says "THE END" in the last line, so if you don't
see that, your decoder crashed somehow before, which should always be
cause for concern.

All lines in this file are exactly 79 characters long (plus the line
feed). In addition, all lines end with "|", except for the two test
lines 2.1.1 and 2.2.1, which contain non-printable ASCII controls
U+0000 and U+007F. If you display this file with a fixed-width font,
these "|" characters should all line up in column 79 (right margin).
This allows you to test quickly, whether your UTF-8 decoder finds the
correct number of characters in every line, that is whether each
malformed sequences is replaced by a single replacement character.

Note that, as an alternative to the notion of malformed sequence used
here, it is also a perfectly acceptable (and in some situations even
preferable) solution to represent each individual byte of a malformed
sequence with a replacement character. If you follow this strategy in
your decoder, then please ignore the "|" column.

The following sequences are not malformed according to the letter of          |
the Unicode 2.0 standard. However, they are longer then necessary and         |
a correct UTF-8 encoder is not allowed to produce them. A "safe UTF-8         |
decoder" should reject them just like malformed sequences for two             |
reasons: (1) It helps to debug applications if overlong sequences are         |
not treated as valid representations of characters, because this helps        |
to spot problems more quickly. (2) Overlong sequences provide                 |
alternative representations of characters, that could maliciously be          |
used to bypass filters that check only for ASCII characters. For              |
instance, a 2-byte encoded line feed (LF) would not be caught by a            |
line counter that counts only 0x0a bytes, but it would still be               |
processed as a line feed by an unsafe UTF-8 decoder later in the              |
pipeline. From a security point of view, ASCII compatibility of UTF-8         |
sequences means also, that ASCII characters are *only* allowed to be          |
represented by ASCII bytes in the range 0x00-0x7f. To ensure this             |
aspect of ASCII compatibility, use only "safe UTF-8 decoders" that            |
reject overlong UTF-8 sequences for which a shorter encoding exists.          |
                                                                              |

With a safe UTF-8 decoder, all of the following five overlong                 |
representations of the ASCII character slash ("/") should be rejected         |
like a malformed UTF-8 sequence, for instance by substituting it with         |
a replacement character. If you see a slash below, you do not have a          |
safe UTF-8 decoder!                                                           |

The following "noncharacters" are "reserved for internal use" by              |
applications, and according to older versions of the Unicode Standard         |
"should never be interchanged". Unicode Corrigendum #9 dropped the            |
latter restriction. Nevertheless, their presence in incoming UTF-8 data       |
can remain a potential security risk, depending on what use is made of        |
these codes subsequently. Examples of such internal use:                      |
                                                                              |
 - Some file APIs with 16-bit characters may use the integer value -1         |
   = U+FFFF to signal an end-of-file (EOF) or error condition.                |
                                                                              |
 - In some UTF-16 receivers, code point U+FFFE might trigger a                |
   byte-swap operation (to convert between UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE).            |
                                                                              |
With such internal use of noncharacters, it may be desirable and safer        |
to block those code points in UTF-8 decoders, as they should never            |
occur legitimately in incoming UTF-8 data, and could trigger unsafe           |
behaviour in subsequent processing.                                           |
