# background 
Roko's Basilisk is the name of a virtually all-powerful but rogue artificial intelligence that would punish every human being who did not contribute to bring about its existence, including those from the past who merely knew about it and did not support its development. It is a thought experiment originally posted by user Roko on the rationalist online community LessWrong and is considered by some as a technological version of Pascal's Wager.<p>

# how to use
